    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Scrumptious scrambled eggs are soft, creamy, and velvety, with a delicate texture that melts in your mouth. They're gently cooked to perfection, with just the right balance of fluffiness and richness.</p>
    <p>The golden-yellow color hints at the buttery flavor that coats each bite, and the eggs are lightly seasoned with salt and pepper, allowing the natural taste to shine. If you like, a bit of cheese or fresh herbs can be folded in, adding an extra layer of indulgence. Each forkful is comforting, warm, and satisfyingâ€”like a cozy morning on a plate.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk eggs with salt until completely combined and very foamy.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a skillet over low heat until bubbling. Add whisked eggs; cook, stirring frequently for even, moist curds, until thickened and creamy, but still shiny, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove scrambled eggs from the pan before they begin to look dry, as they will continue to thicken off the heat.</li>
    </ol>
