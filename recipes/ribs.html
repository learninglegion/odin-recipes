    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="rib-para">BBQ ribs are a smoky, tender masterpiece, each rack glazed with a caramelized, tangy-sweet sauce that has just the right balance of heat and sweetness.</p>
    <p class="rib-para">The meat is fall-off-the-bone tender, yet holds its shape with a perfect bite. As you take a bite, the smoky flavor dances on your taste buds, while the sauce gives a glossy, sticky coating that adds a rich, mouthwatering depth. The ribs are charred to perfection on the edges, offering a slight crispy texture that contrasts beautifully with the juicy, succulent meat. Each bite is a satisfying explosion of flavor, a perfect combination of savory, smoky, and sweet. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pounds pork spareribs</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup chile sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup ketchup</li>
        <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup rum</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dry mustard</li>
        <li>1 dash ground black pepper</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cut spareribs into serving size portions; wrap in double thickness of foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 1 ½ hours. Unwrap and drain drippings. (I usually freeze drippings to use later in soups.) Place ribs in a large roasting pan.</li>
        <li>Mix brown sugar, chile sauce, ketchup, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, rum, garlic, mustard, and pepper together in a bowl. Coat ribs with sauce and marinate at room temperature for 1 hour or refrigerate for 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat the grill to medium heat. Position the grate 4 inches above heat source; grease the grate with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Cook ribs on the preheated grill for 30 minutes, basting with marinade.</li>
    </ol>
