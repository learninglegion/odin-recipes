    <h2>Steak</h2>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A delicious steak is tender and juicy, with a perfectly seared crust that adds a satisfying crunch. The inside is cooked to your preferred doneness, from a soft, pink medium-rare to a more well-done, hearty bite. However, if you like your steaks well-done, I take pity on your soul.</p>
        <p>The rich, savory flavors of the beef are enhanced by a touch of seasoningâ€”maybe a sprinkle of salt, cracked black pepper, or a hint of garlic. It might be finished off with a dollop of butter that melts into the meat, adding an extra layer of richness. Every bite is an indulgence in flavor and texture.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>16 oz ribeye steak</li>
            <li>1 tbsp kosher salt</li>
            <li>1.5 tsp ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tbsp avocado oil</li>
            <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Salt both sides of steak with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt per steak. Place steak in an airtight container and refrigerate 48 hours. </li>
            <li>Remove steak from the refrigerator about 30 minutes prior to cooking. Sprinkle both sides of steak with black pepper. </li>
            <li>Heat a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until very hot. Add avocado oil; heat until oil shimmers.</li>
            <li>Carefully place steak in skillet. Cook until brown and hard-seared on one side, 4 to 5 minutes. </li>
            <li>Flip steak; top with 1 teaspoon butter. Cook until desired doneness, or 3 to 4 minutes more. Keep cooked steak in a 170 degrees F ( 77 degrees C) oven until ready to serve. </li>
        </ol>
